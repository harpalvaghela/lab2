# Breast Cancer Diagnostic Prediction using Logistic Regression

This repository contains a machine learning model built with logistic regression to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer (malignant or benign) based on features extracted from digitized images of breast mass. 
The model is trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The repo includes python code with data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature importance visualization.
